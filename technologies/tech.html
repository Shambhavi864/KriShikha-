    <h1>Agricultural Technologies</h1>
    <p>The agriculture industry has been going through a gradual transformation in the past 50 years.<br> Automation in irrigation, farm machinery, and harvesting further ease farm operations while minimizing losses. startups also develop sustainable agriculture solutions and thus advance new growing techniques. </p>
    <p><h2>What are the new emerging technologies in agriculture?</h2> <br>
      <li><i> Precision agriculture</i> <br> Sustainability in agriculture refers to the use of eco-friendly methods and inputs which have zero or minimal negative impact on the environment. An example of this is site-specific crop and livestock management, commonly known as precision agriculture. It is a method in which farmers use exact amounts of input, such as water, pesticides, and fertilizers, to enhance the quality and productivity of yield.<br>Examples of precision agriculture companies: CIBO, Tata Kisan Kendra </li> <br>
      <li><i>AgDrones (Agricultural Drones)</i> <br> Increasing farm productivity while saving costs is challenging. But drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), help farmers overcome this hassle in an effective way. Drones collect raw data which translates into useful information for farm monitoring. Drones equipped with cameras facilitate aerial imaging and surveying of near and far-stretched fields. This data optimizes the application of fertilizers, water, seeds, and pesticides, driving precision agriculture. <br>Examples of agriculture drone companies: DJI, senseFly eBee SQ
</li> <br>
<li> <i>Vertical Farming</i> <br> Vertical Farming is the method of producing food on vertically stacked layers. It aids in maximizing production output in a limited space.

These systems are built-in facilities such as a skyscraper, tunnels, shipping containers, old mine shafts, or repurposed warehouse.

These facilities function through Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) techniques. <br>Vertical farming examples: AeroFarms, IKEA’s Malmö store </li> <br>
<li><i>Cattle Tracking</i> <br> A system that uses IoT sensors, cloud, and GPS-enabled devices, to help ranchers can track cattle over a large area. It aids in Precise animal identification,
Heat detection to improve conception and insemination,
Disease tracking <br>Examples of cattle tracking companies: Semtech LoRa, Cowlar </li> <br>
<li><i>Agricultural Robots </i> <br> Shortage of labor is a critical problem farmers face, and this is amplified in the case of large field operations. So, startups are manufacturing agricultural robots to assist farmers in fruit-picking, harvesting, planting, transplanting, spraying, seeding, and weeding. Moreover, robots are used in automated systems for livestock management as well. <br>Examples of agricultural robots: Ecorobotix, Berry 5, Scout System
</li> <br>
<li><i>Aquaponics</i> <br> Aquaponics is the combination of aquaculture (artificially raising aquatic animals like fish, snails, etc.) and hydroponics (soil-less plant production).
  Its benefits include low water usage,
  all-season food growth,
  low weeds usage,
  faster vegetable growth,
  inexpensive to set up and maintain,
  enhanced food security.
