    <h1>Waste Management</h1>
    <p>Waste management is all about how to dispose off all the things you don't want on the farm. <br>The Hazardous Substances Management Division (HSMD) is the nodal point within the Ministry for management of chemical emergencies and hazardous substances. The main objective of the Division is to promote safe management and use of hazardous substances including hazardous chemicals and hazardous wastes, in order to avoid damage to health and environment.  In India, a major fraction of farm waste is generated from the dairy enterprise, crop fields, household uses, etc. in the form of animal waste, crop residue, household waste respectively. </p>
    <p>
      <h2>What classifies as Agricultural Waste?</h2> <br> <li>Food and meat processing <br> Examples, bones, banana peels, feathers</li> <li>Horticulture <br>Examples, wastes generated in the orchards, parks and gardens and roadside plants</li> <li>Animal Production/Livestock <br> Examples, Animal litter, water, dung</li> <li>Crop Production <br>Examples, crop residues and husks</li> <li>Chemicals <br>Examples, Insecticides, pesticides</li>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>Why do we need Agricultural Waste Management?</h2> <br>
      <li>Problem of landfills.</li> <br> <li>Emission of toxic gases</li> <br> <li>Degradation of soil.</li> <br> <li>Indirect effect on animals</li> <br> <li>Climate change.</li>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>Waste Management Techniques</h2> <br>
      <li>Composting - Kitchen waste or crop wastage can also come in use as animal feed, fertilizer and bioenergy.

It converts into animal feed by sterilization, bioenergy by anaerobic digestion and fertilizer by composting.

They actually make for good compost and fertilizer as they contain nutrients and organic matter. </li> <br>
     <li>Silica is great for the skin, hair, nails, bones mineralization and calcification as well as immunity.

It decreases in the body as you age.

Though, you can attain it through agricultural wastes.

Silica can be produced and extracted from corn cobs, bagasse, rice straw and husk.</li> <br>
<li>Whenever you have leftover pesticides or insecticides, do not sump them in waterways.

In fact, consider selling it or giving it to another farmer.</li> <br>
<li>Bioenergy - Bioenergy and Biofuel is a sustainable renewable source of energy that convert waste to energy.

Moreover, it also shows promise in reducing Carbon dioxide emissions.

The conversion of biomass into biofuel and alternative energy resources will decrease economic losses.

It will also overcome the release of gases by burning wastes as well as increase the production of energy.

Therefore, you can recycle wastes from agriculture and farming to reduce the impact waste has on the environment and humans.</li> <br>
<li>Incineration/Combustion - Incineration or combustion is a type of disposal method in which municipal solid wastes are burned at high temperatures so as to convert them into residue and gaseous products.</li>
