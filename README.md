# KriShikha


The goal of our website Krishikha, which in hindi means 'female farmer', aimed especially at the female farmer workforce, is to provide information about the services or schemes available to krishikas.

We aim at giving female farmers of our country an exclusive platform where they have access to every information about farming, be it crops, weather, maps of their regional area. Krishikha is designed with keeping farmers in mind as well as the average person who wishes to cultivate veggies for their daily needs. It provides our krishikas with the complete crop, pesticide, and insecticide information.

It keeps a krishika up to date on all crop, pesticide, and insecticide information, as well as financial information. It gives extensive instructions on which crops to plant during which seasons and which crops are most suited to the farmer's location.

 Challenges we ran into :

Getting the precise information about weather was a bit tricky part that we faced while building this project.
Gathering information about the various schemes and features required a thorough research.
Solved the problem using open weather API
